# Donation Form UI Update

Based on the image provided, the new donation form should have:

## Design Features:

1. **Orange/Golden background** (#D4A574 or similar)
2. **Three donation categories** with radio buttons:
   - Sai Aangan
   - General Donation to Sai Mandir
   - Service to Needy Program
3. **Multiple amount options** as radio buttons (not clickable boxes)
4. **Clean white input fields** for:
   - First Name
   - Last Name
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Additional Information (textarea)
5. **Total Amount field** (auto-calculated or manual)
6. **Donate button** at bottom
7. **Tax deductible notice**

## Implementation:

- Remove the complex multi-step form
- Use simple radio buttons for amounts
- Clean, minimal design
- Better spacing and typography
- Mobile responsive

The form should be simpler and more user-friendly than the current
implementation.
